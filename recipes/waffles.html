        <h2>Great Tasting Waffles</h2>
        <p>If you're craving Waffle House waffles try this easy copycat recipe - you won't taste the difference. Serve with maple syrup, butter, and chocolate chips.</p>
        <p>Waffle: a leavened batter or dough cooked between two hot plates of a waffle iron, patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and grid-like surface impression. Waffles are cooked until they become golden-brown in color, with a crispy outer texture and a soft interior.</p>
